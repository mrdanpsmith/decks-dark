== Usage

=== Adding a new deck
Add a new deck into the service using a PUT request with a complete deck in starting order.

The end of the URL (in this example "test") will be the name of the new deck.
include::{snippets}/putDeck/curl-request.adoc[lines=1..5]
...
include::{snippets}/putDeck/curl-request.adoc[lines=50..-1]

If you include the 52 unique cards, you should get a success response.
include::{snippets}/putDeck/http-response.adoc[]

If the deck contains duplicates, or is missing cards, you will get an error response.
include::{snippets}/badPutRequest/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/badPutRequest/http-response.adoc[]

=== Viewing a deck
If you know the name of the deck you want, you can view it via GET request.
include::{snippets}/getDeck/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/getDeck/http-response.adoc[]

If you attempt to query for a deck that is not stored in the service, you will get a 404 error response.
include::{snippets}/deckNotFound/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/deckNotFound/http-response.adoc[]

=== Shuffling the deck
After you have a deck to shuffle, you can shuffle it via POST request using the name you PUT it under.
include::{snippets}/shuffleDeck/curl-request.adoc[]

In return you will get a success response if the deck is found.
include::{snippets}/shuffleDeck/http-response.adoc[]

You can view the deck has been shuffled via GET request.

*Before*
include::{snippets}/deckBeforeShuffle/http-response.adoc[]

*After*
include::{snippets}/deckAfterShuffle/http-response.adoc[]

If you request to shuffle a deck that is not stored in the service, you will receive an error response.
include::{snippets}/deckToShuffleNotFound/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/deckToShuffleNotFound/http-response.adoc[]

=== Getting the deck list
After you have added a deck, you should be able to issue a GET to the service root to get the list of decks.
include::{snippets}/getDeckList/curl-request.adoc[]

In return you will get an array of named decks.
include::{snippets}/getDeckList/http-response.adoc[]

=== Deleting a deck
Delete a deck by issuing a DELETE request with the name of the deck to delete.
include::{snippets}/deleteDeck/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/deleteDeck/http-response.adoc[]

*Note: deleting a deck will return a successful response even if the deck has not been persisted.*

== Deck shuffling strategies
Two shuffling strategies are included with this microservice:
 * Simple in-place strategy (default) - uses Collections.shuffle on the deck's cards to shuffle them in place.
 * Interlace strategy - splits the deck in half and then interlaces one from each half one after the other. By default it completes this process ten times before completion.

You can switch which is used at deploy time by setting the spring profile.

----
java -jar ./target/decks-dark-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=interlace-shuffle
----

If you want to change the number of iterations that the interlace shuffle does, you can also configure that at deploy time by specifying it as well.

Here is an example to make the shuffler use do only one iteration per shuffle.
----
java -jar ./target/decks-dark-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --interlace.iterations=1 --spring.profiles.active=interlace-shuffle
